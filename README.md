# Notebooks for DTU course 10122 Statistical Physics

These notebooks are used in course 10122 in the Fall semester 2023.  They are placed on github to make it easy to import them to Google Colab.

Anybody not following the course are still welcome to use them (in the unlikely case you find them useful).  Do with them as you will.
