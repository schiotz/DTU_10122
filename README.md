# Notebooks for DTU course 10122 Statistical Physics

These notebooks are used in course 10122 in the Fall semester 2023.  They are placed on github to make it easy to import them to Google Colab.

Anybody not following the course are still welcome to use them (in the unlikely case you find them useful).  Do with them as you will.

There are two separate computer exercises.

## Monte Carlo simulation of the Ising model

Files:

* ``MonteCarloSimulation.tex``: The document describing the exercise.
* ``IsingModel.ipynb``: The student version of the simulation notebook.
* ``IsingModel_TeacherVersion.ipynb``: The instructors version of the notebook.

## Molecular Dynamics of a Lennard-Jones gas

Files:

* ``MolecularDynamics.tex``: The document describing the exercise.
* ``SimulationGuide.ipynb``: Notebook generating the Figure 1 for the document above.
* ``references.bib``: BibTex file for the Latex document above.
* ``MolecularDynamics.ipynb``: The simulation notebook - no instructor version is available.

Note that figure 2 for the document is borrowed from Wikipedia, it is figure 2 of the article [Lennard-Jones potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lennard-Jones_potential) and can be downloaded [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lennard-Jones_potential#/media/File:LJ_PhaseDiagram.png). 


## Running in Google Colab

You can run the Monte Carlo simulation in Google Colab by clicking on the Colab badges below.  Unfortunately, the Molecular Dynamics simulation notebook is useless in Colab, as it needs to open a new window to display graphics that updates as the simulation runs.
